Statamic CP Theme Clean
================================

## Installing
1. Download the zip file (or clone via git) and unzip it or clone the repo into `/_add-ons/`.
2. Ensure the folder name is `cp_clean` (Github timestamps the download folder). Feel free to rename if you wish.
3. Enjoy.

## Usage
This add-on will load the included stylesheets after all others. It was designed to simply color and flatten out the interface.
